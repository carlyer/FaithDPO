Pipeline comparison example for FaithDPO

This example demonstrates how to compare the two FaithDPO pipelines on the same input,
with detailed extractiveness heatmaps for visual comparison.

Galileo Galilei, renowned as one of the most influential figures in the history of science, made numerous contributions that revolutionized our understanding of physics and astronomy. His meticulous work with telescopes led to groundbreaking discoveries about the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus. Beyond the realm of astronomy, his observations and experiments laid the foundation for classical mechanics. One of Galileo's lesser-known achievements is his development of the Three Laws of Motion, which were critical in advancing the study of kinematics and dynamics. These laws articulate the principles of inertia, the relationship between force and motion, and the law of action and reaction, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding moving bodies. His work on pendulums also contributed substantially to timekeeping and horology, as he discovered that pendulums of different lengths oscillate at predictable periods, a principle still applied in modern clocks.
